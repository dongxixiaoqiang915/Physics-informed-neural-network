# Physics-informed Neural Network for Phase Imaging based on Transport of Intensity Equation
PINN is a cascaded deep neural network incorporated with forward and inverse Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE) physics model. In the reference paper, we use a deep convolutional neural netwrok (Unet++) as a regularizer term to solve an iterative optimization problem.
